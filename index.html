                                been granted the chance to persue many different interests to create a unique background that truly speaks to 
                                who I am and what I want to do in life. It has forced me to have a multidiscplinary background that has helped

                                        While rather basic, these concepts helped lead us into neural networks. The neural networks we created

                                        employ when creating chat bot routines. Perhaps more importantly, however, the course introduced a wide swath 
                                        of ethical questions to consider as well. Here I learned that it was not just important to make something that 
                                        works, but also to make something that will improve the lives of users.

                                After my proposal, the next part of my process was conducting my research on smart grids. I knew very little 
                                about smart grids prior to this project, but by the end I had learned many of the intricacies and difficulties 
                                faced by proponents of smart grids. I was able to comb through a relatively dense number of sources by using key 
                                words when searching and skimming through the abstracts and sections of ones I opened. The ability to process 
                                a lot of this material and data quickly aided me greatly in selecting great sources.

                                create a convincing argument. This proved to be a longer process than I imagined, but I thoroughly enjoyed 
                                piecing together relevant information from different sources to build my argument and position.

                                        After my proposal, the next part of my process was conducting my research on smart grids. I knew very little 
                                        about smart grids prior to this project, but by the end I had learned many of the intricacies and difficulties 
                                        faced by proponents of smart grids. I was able to comb through a relatively dense number of sources by using key 
                                        words when searching and skimming through the abstracts and sections of ones I opened. The ability to process 
                                        a lot of this material and data quickly aided me greatly in selecting great sources.

                                        Once I had selected my sources, the next challenge came in choosing the information that I wanted to use. I 
                                        wanted to convey the main ideas and ways to go about smart grids but also infuse some of the finer details to 
                                        create a convincing argument. This proved to be a longer process than I imagined, but I thoroughly enjoyed 
                                        piecing together relevant information from different sources to build my argument and position.

                                        work I had already compiled to make a presentation that surpassed the standards I had set for myself. While 
                                        the slides looked clean and slick, there were a few challenges - both technical and personal - that I had to

                                        A good presentation makes use of more than just walls of text. I was able to include photos and infographics 
                                        that helped strengthen my slides as well as let my audience know what my main points were. Picking good graphics

                                        The biggest challenge I faced, however, was my life-long fear of giving presentations. I had never been the best 
                                        public speaker growing up, so having to give a presentation that I had spent ten weeks preparing for was a daunting 
                                        task. Thanks to the lessons I learned and the critical critiques of my instructor, I delivered my presentation with 
                                        confidence and clarity. I know that this experience has helped me become a better public speaker in all situations

                                        thorough in my work and being receptive to feedback is key to having a learning mindset. My ability to speak 
                                        with confidence and create both strong oral and written arguments has greatly improved since taking this course.

                                I created this mock website as part of a project proposal during an internship I did. It started out as 
                                just an illustration of a landing page and subpage, but I decided to copy over as much of the existing content 
                                as I could to show what different styles we could persue and what changes I would make to how and where information

                                        I was introduced to web design during a class in high school. It wasn't the focus of the class, but I knew I 
                                        wanted to get started in coding somewhere that I could see my results. After graduating, I purchased an online
                                         class that promised to make me a full-stack developer. It all started with the fundamentals of HTML. After 
                                        learning about the DOM and some HTML tags, we were introduced to styling with CSS.

                                        It didn't take long until I wanted more than just pleasing asethetics out of my websites. By this point, I had 
                                        already taken a programming fundamentals course in Python so learning JavaScript came much more naturally. I 
                                        learned JavaScript when vars were commonplace over lets and consts, but I have since retaught myself JavaScript to work with 
                                        the modern capabilities of JavaScript.

                                        I created this mock website as part of a project proposal during an internship I did. It started out as 
                                        just an illustration of a landing page and subpage, but I decided to copy over as much of the existing content 
                                        as I could to show what different styles we could persue and what changes I would make to how and where information

                                        that I lacked. I finally decided to tackle this website to show off not just who I am, but also creating a living

                                        While my site isn't infinite scrolling in the true sense of Twitter or Instagram, I opted to keep the majority 
                                        of my content on a single page. I feel like presenting myself as if this was an extrapolated resume creates a 
                                        familiar feel for recruiters viewing my site. I wanted to make the contact me form another page so that people 
                                        who wished to contact me would do so deliberately and not just stumble upon the page. In the end, I am happy 
                                        with the product I have designed and developed for myself and enjoyed playing with ways to make the site more 
                                        interactive.

    Leadership - Growing up, I was never a loud kid or someone who played on a sports team. Being the reserved kid I was, however, allowed me 
    to observe a lot of different situations and learn from them. As I got into middle school and then high school, I frequently found myself 
    being put into situational leadership roles and enjoying it. I've come to enjoy being in a position where others look upon me for help and 
    guidance, and knowing that the success or failure of my team rests on my shoulders. Personally, I thrive and work best when under this sort 
    of pressure and enjoy driving others to also do their best. I like making sure that everyone is able to get the most out of the experience 
    and time spent collaborating together. 

    Passion - Whether it be hockey or video games to course work and actual work, I always like getting invested in my activities and interests. 
    It doesn't take a lot for me to dig myself into a good groove when working on things. When I am enjoying what I am working on or having fun, I 
    know I do my best and produce the best results. Being so involved with certain things also allows me to hone my skills in different areas and 
    keep track of the tools I have acquired. This means I can quickly pull on different resources and think through situations in different ways 
    because of my committment to give my best and feel the best. 

    Curiosity - In 8th grade, I would stay afterschool and complete algebra problems with my math teacher because he noticed my knack for wanting 
    to learn more. The normal curriculum I was enrolled in at the time was not offering enough to truly challenge me and spark my intellectual 
    curiosity. Since then, I have always been trying to go beyond the class room and learn more about topics briefly mentioned or things I overhear. 
    It fascinates me to read about things I never knew existed or find new connections between topics I already know. It is also important to me to 
    always stay curious and never lose the flame inside that inspires me to keep learning and discovering new things. I believe complaceny is what leads 
    to both burnout and lower quality results, so always having something new on my plate is something I am always anticipating and ready for. That said, 
    I can sometimes be a slow learner but I am determined to never give up!
