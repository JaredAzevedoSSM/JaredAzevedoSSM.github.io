                                        I spent ten weeks working for my tribe, the Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians, in the Executive Office. I

                                        initially wanting to work with their tech department, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Executive Office.

                                        The next couple of assignments looked a lot more like what I expected. It started with us implementing a 
                                        Naive-Bayes classifier and then Logistic Regression. For the first time, I was able to use my prior coding

                                        After my proposal, the next part of my process was conducting my research on smart grids. I knew very little 
                                        about smart grids prior to this project, but by the end I had learned many of the intricacies and difficulties 
                                        faced by proponents of smart grids. I was able to comb through a relatively dense number of sources by using key 
                                        words when searching and skimming through the abstracts and sections of ones I opened. The ability to process 
                                        a lot of this material and data quickly aided me greatly in selecting great sources.

                                        Once I had selected my sources, the next challenge came in choosing the information that I wanted to use. I 
                                        wanted to convey the main ideas and ways to go about smart grids but also infuse some of the finer details to 
                                        create a convincing argument. This proved to be a longer process than I imagined, but I thoroughly enjoyed 
                                        piecing together relevant information from different sources to build my argument and position.

                                        Figuring which parts of my research to include in my presentation was a rewarding task. I enjoyed using the 
                                        work I had already compiled to make a presentation that surpassed the standards I had set for myself. While 
                                        the slides looked clean and slick, there were a few challenges - both technical and personal - that I had to

                                        A good presentation makes use of more than just walls of text. I was able to include photos and infographics

                                        The biggest challenge I faced, however, was my life-long fear of giving presentations. I had never been the best 
                                        public speaker growing up, so having to give a presentation that I had spent ten weeks preparing for was a daunting 
                                        task. Thanks to the lessons I learned and the critical critiques of my instructor, I delivered my presentation with 
                                        confidence and clarity. I know that this experience has helped me become a better public speaker in all situations

                                        I was introduced to web design during a class in high school. It wasn't the focus of the class, but I knew I 
                                        wanted to get started in coding somewhere that I could see my results. After graduating, I purchased an online
                                         class that promised to make me a full-stack developer. It all started with the fundamentals of HTML. After 
                                        learning about the DOM and some HTML tags, we were introduced to styling with CSS.

                                        It didn't take long until I wanted more than just pleasing asethetics out of my websites. By this point, I had 
                                        already taken a programming fundamentals course in Python so learning JavaScript came much more naturally. I 
                                        learned JavaScript when vars were commonplace over lets and consts, but I have since retaught myself JavaScript to work with 
                                        the modern capabilities of JavaScript.

                                        The next few lessons focused on working with routing. I was learning how to work with libraries such as node.js

                                        The biggest factor in a lot of the life decisions I have made is my family. Being able to provide and take care 
                                        of them later in life is something I want to have the flexibility to do. It is also important to me that I am 
                                        able to live up to the expectations they had for themselves (i.e. they have been excellent role models).

                                        When people ask where I come from, I usually reply Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. However, the truth is I grew 
                                        up on a small island right across the St. Mary's river from Sault Ste. Marie called Sugar Island. Growing up 
                                        in a close-knit community was incredibly nice and I consider myself fortunate for that, but it did little to
