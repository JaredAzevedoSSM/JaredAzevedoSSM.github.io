                                been granted the chance to persue many different interests to create a unique background that truly speaks to 
                                who I am and what I want to do in life. It has forced me to have a multidiscplinary background that has helped

                                        school, but I wanted to be successful in all aspects of my life. I was inspired by my parents to set myself up 
                                        to make an impact in this world. I was focused on achieving my dreams so that I could give back to my family

                                        up on a small island right across the St. Mary's river from Sault Ste. Marie called Sugar Island. Growing up

                                My first experience in the tech industry came via a software development engineer internship with Amazon.
                                When I first received the offer, I was intimidated by how challenging this opportunity might be, but by the time 
                                I started I was confident and eager to jump in. Twelve weeks later and I am able to say with certainty that this 
                                was the best possible scenario I could have wished for to dip my feet into the water of tech, and big tech at that!

                                I had been coding in the classroom and on the side for years, but neither properly prepared me for what it was like 
                                to code in a work environment. The first thing I had to adapt to was working on a shared codebase and being 
                                encouraged to collaborate with my teammates or look up questions I had. The next challenge I had to overcome was 
                                how to address and respond to feedback on my code reviews. Lastly, I needed to learn internal tools for building 
                                and deploying packages while figuring out how to use git. My usage of git before this internship was just to clone 
                                repos, but there were many more commands and options required this time!

                                The duration of my internship was 12 weeks, but I spent only a handful of days in the office my team was housed in. 
                                At the start of my internship, I had the goal of going into the office the vast majority of the time (~4 times a week), 
                                but mostly empty offices and the advantages of working from home ended up flipping that plan on its head. While I didn't 
                                go into the office as much as I initially wanted to, I enjoyed every second of my work whether I was working from my 
                                apartment or within one of the Amazon offices. When I wasn't working, I took some time to explore Seattle. I didn't 
                                stray far from the city since I didn't have my own car, but I was able to enjoy a couple of the major attractions such 
                                as the Space Needle and the diverse variety of local eateries that Seattle offers.

                                the Executive Office. I worked directly under the Assistant Executive Director and was frequently involved with 
                                projects that would span across the entire Tribe. I was able to get through a lot of this work rather quickly, so 
                                I was allowed to work on my own project. Even before employment with the Tribe, I knew their website was antiquated 
                                and needed a much needed update. I brought this idea up to my supervisor and she was in full agreement. I quickly 
                                began working on a mock website that was meant to just include a new landing page and a template for what the other 
                                pages could look like along with an alternate design for the entire website, but it quickly grew into me recreating 
                                nearly half of the existing website. None of this work felt truly like work, as I thoroughly enjoyed being able to 
                                work on so many different facets of the Tribe and on a coding project that was right up my ally!

                                Outside of reading a couple of articles about AI and looking into a Google AI page, I never had formal coursework 
                                about artificial intelligence. The untapped potential of AI, however, has me incredibly excited and I knew from 
                                an early point in my undergraduate years that I would want to concentrate on this corner of computer science. Not

                                One of the best parts of this class was the final project. It was the perfect culmination of using the AI concepts

                                        The first assignment started off by making us enforce spam rules in Python with regular expressions. It 
                                        was a small building block that I was not sure would be very helpful outside of niche situations, but as 
                                        the class progressed I realized how important being able to use regexes were in natural langauge processing!

                                The writing and rhetoric (PWR) program gave me the chance to research and write about a topic of my interest. While

                                with my interest in sustainable energy and how AI plays into that picture. With that in mind, I ended up choosing

                                and studies that have been published on smart grids and how they can revolutionize the power grid. I was also able

                                        After my proposal, the next part of my process was conducting my research on smart grids. I knew very little 
                                        about smart grids prior to this project, but by the end I had learned many of the intricacies and difficulties 
                                        faced by proponents of smart grids. I was able to comb through a relatively dense number of sources by using key 
                                        words when searching and skimming through the abstracts and sections of ones I opened. The ability to process 
                                        a lot of this material and data quickly aided me greatly in selecting great sources.

                                        wanted to convey the main ideas and ways to go about smart grids but also infuse some of the finer details to 
                                        create a convincing argument. This proved to be a longer process than I imagined, but I thoroughly enjoyed 
                                        piecing together relevant information from different sources to build my argument and position.

                                        The biggest challenge I faced, however, was my life-long fear of giving presentations. I had never been the best 
                                        public speaker growing up, so having to give a presentation that I had spent ten weeks preparing for was a daunting 
                                        task. Thanks to the lessons I learned and the critical critiques of my instructor, I delivered my presentation with 
                                        confidence and clarity. I know that this experience has helped me become a better public speaker in all situations

                                        albeit on paper. I was able to use my presentation that had been recorded and transcribed to form the majority 
                                        of my paper, but the key in making an excellent white paper was having the ability to make the edits and transitions 
                                        necessary. A lot of the phrases I used in my presentation didn't make much sense as words on paper, so making 
                                        adjustments was pivotal.

                                My interest for designing and coding websites started in a high school media course that wasn't even about website 
                                coding. After finishing all of the assigned work quicker than my classmates, the teacher gave me a login to an old 
                                online course that covered the rudimentary parts of both HTML and CSS. Ever since, I have loved creating websites 
                                and soon after this class I wanted to learn more. This led me to searching for courses online and finally deciding 
                                on a Udemy course that was on sale.

                                After covering HTML and CSS again, I got a much better introduction to modern JavaScript before moving onto some

                                with was databases. I was introduced to both SQL and NoSQL database types, but worked with MongoDB (a NoSQL 
                                database) throughout the course. I was finally ready to build application with persistant data and information 
                                such as user accounts and shopping carts.

                                        I was introduced to web design during a class in high school. It wasn't the focus of the class, but I knew I 
                                        wanted to get started in coding somewhere that I could see my results. After graduating, I purchased an online
                                         class that promised to make me a full-stack developer. It all started with the fundamentals of HTML. After 
                                        learning about the DOM and some HTML tags, we were introduced to styling with CSS.

                                        already taken a programming fundamentals course in Python so learning JavaScript came much more naturally. I 
                                        learned JavaScript when vars were commonplace over lets and consts, but I have since retaught myself JavaScript to work with

                                        The next few lessons focused on working with routing. I was learning how to work with libraries such as node.js 
                                        and express.js to create truly dynamic webpages that could serve both personal and commercial use.

                                        My favorite concept that I learned to play with was databases. I was introduced to both SQL and non-SQL 
                                        database types, but worked with MongoDB (a non SQL database) throughout the course. I was finally ready 
                                        to build application with persistant data and information such as user accounts and shopping carts.

                                        I created this mock website as part of a project proposal during an internship I did. It started out as 
                                        just an illustration of a landing page and subpage, but I decided to copy over as much of the existing content 
                                        as I could to show what different styles we could persue and what changes I would make to how and where information

                                        While my site isn't infinite scrolling in the true sense of Twitter or Instagram, I opted to keep the majority

                                        familiar feel for recruiters viewing my site. I wanted to make the contact me form another page so that people 
                                        who wished to contact me would do so deliberately and not just stumble upon the page. In the end, I am happy
